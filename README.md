#VSCodium Updater

The goal of this project is create an updater for VSCodium in C.

It may be unnecessary but I'm doing it for learning purposes.

In the end, if this goes far, I'd like to be capable of:

Updating VSCodium
-
At first the builds, then AppImages and maybe allow for building source code.
and making it feel "native"

Getting older versions and allowing for switching of those.
-
If possible, allowing for that with different formats 

Configuration
-
Of save location, download and not update, etc.


Cooler visuals 
-

If this turns robust enough, allow for other programs to be added too
-
